# To-do-List
In this project I created a web-based to-do list application with unique features. This web-app is titled "HARMONY LIST" which serves as a to-do list application.   
•	The page layout includes a navigation bar at the top, which can be toggled to switch between different color themes (light color scheme, minimal text and a dark and vibrant color scheme). The main content area consists of a to-do list section and a collection of yellow stars (only visible in dark and vibrant color scheme to add gamification).  
•	Users can add tasks by typing them in an input box and clicking the "Add" button. Each task is displayed in a list, and completed tasks are visually marked with a checkmark. When a task is marked as complete, a yellow star is added to the star collection.  
In a nutshell, the web page allows users to switch between light and dark themes, changing the background color and styling of the page elements and is mobile/laptop/tablet responsive.
